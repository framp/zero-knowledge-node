  <p>This is an interactive demonstration of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">zero knowledge proof
  protocol</a> for 3-colorable graphs.  Zero-knowledge proofs permit
  you to convince a <em>verifier</em> of the truth of a fact (namely,
  that a graph is three colorable), without revealing the actual three
  coloring of the graph.</p>
  <p>This application allows you to play the game as a verifier.  The
  application (the prover) offers you a graph whose colorings are
  obscured from you, and you are allowed to pick an edge, which the
  verifier will reveal the coloring of.  Select a graph and
  try clicking on some edges.</p>

  <p>You may notice
  that the colors change between different rounds of the game; although
  the prover is not allowed to change its mind once it offers you a
  choice, it's allowed to mix up the colorings between choices.  Indeed, if it didn't,
  you could reverse engineer the full coloring (making this not a
  zero-knowledge proof.) You can check that the application is not reneging
  on its promises by pressing the <em>Reveal</em> button. (Since this
  tells you what the true coloring is, this is obviously not part
  of the zero-knowledge protocol!)</p>
  <p>Once you get tired of clicking edges manually, you can select Turbo
  to speed things up.  As you play more rounds of the protocol, the
  probability that the prover is lying (the graph is not 3-colorable)
  but has managed to get lucky in the edges you picked goes down: this
  is reflected in the confidence metric.</p>
  <p><em>Exercise 1:</em> Currently, you can only select adjacent pairs
  of nodes to check.  Would the proof still be zero knowledge if you
  could pick arbitrary pairs of nodes to check?</p>
  <p><em>Exercise 2:</em> The equation currently being used for confidence is <code>1-(1/E)^n</code>, where <code>E</code> is the number of edges in the graph, and <code>n</code> is the number of trials run. Is this the correct equation? Why is there no prior?</p>
